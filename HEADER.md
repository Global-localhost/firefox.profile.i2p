# firefox.profile.i2p

Much of this is ready for interested parties to test, but it's still just being
tested and the rough edges are still being figured out. Use at your own risk.

For now, the testing release page is here: [Github Releases](https://github.com/eyedeekay/firefox.profile.i2p/releases/tag/current)
where the Windows installer has been made available. The "current" release will
always track the newest working version. Sometime in early 2019, this will be
integrated with the i2p installer on Windows.

## What it is

This is a profile for Firefox, pre-configured to use i2p, with an accompanying
launcher for easy use. It also comes pre-configured to disable certain features
that may weaken the anonymity that i2p provides, and with NoScript and HTTPS
Everywhere.
