### Automatic Setup (Recommended, Windows) [Standalone guide](WINDOWS.md)

  0. Install the Firefox web browser. You can download it from
    [Mozilla's web site](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).
    *Alternatively, if you're using the latest testing version of the profile,*
    *it will use a Tor Browser if one is found in a default location,* which you
    can get from the [Tor Browser Bundle download page](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en).
    This may provide additional security.
  1. Download the i2p Firefox profile installer, install-i2pbrowser.exe, from
    [This releases page](https://github.com/eyedeekay/firefox.profile.i2p/releases/download/current/install-i2pbrowser.exe)
    and run it. If Firefox was not detected in the default location, then you
    will be offered a menu to select it in a custom location.
  2. To start Firefox with the i2p Browsing profile, click the shortcut to
    "I2PBrowser-Launcher" or "Private Browsing-I2PBrowser-Launcher" from your
    Start Menu or your Desktop.

### Run-From-Zip (Alternative, Windows)

  0. Install the Firefox web browser. You can download it from
    [Mozilla's web site](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). The
    browser *must* be installed in a default location selected by the Firefox
    installer for this to work. This version does work with Tor Browser yet.
  1. Download the i2p Firefox profile zip bundle, i2pbrowser-windows.zip, from
    [This releases page](https://github.com/eyedeekay/firefox.profile.i2p/releases/download/current/i2pbrowser-windows.zip)
  2. To start Firefox with the i2p Browsing profile, double-click the
    i2pbrower.bat script.
