### Automatic Setup (OSX) [Standalone guide](MACOSX.md)

**Entirely Untested.** I've managed to build .dmg files that contain the scripts
annd the profile. They *should* work, but until I get a Mac, I won't know for
sure. To generate one on a Mac, install create-dmg from brew and run

        make osx

  0. Install the Firefox Web Browser from [Mozilla's web site](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).
    This version doesn't integrate with a Tor Browser Bundle yet.
  1. Install the .dmg file you generated with make.
  2. Launch the I2PBrowser.sh script.
